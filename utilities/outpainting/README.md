# Outpainting

Outpainting in ComfyUI refers to a feature that allows users to extend beyond the boundaries of an image or canvas while editing. It enables seamless rendering and display of content beyond the visible area, providing a more comprehensive view of the entire composition. This feature is particularly useful for designers and artists who need to see the full context of their work.
