This project is a collection of [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/) workflows created during experimental sessions with this tool. Feel free to use and learn from these experiments or even contribute your own findings!

## Requirements

To get started, you need to have a working installation of ComfyUI on your machine. Please refer to the official documentation for instructions on [how to install and set up ComfyUI](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started/pre_package). Once installed, feel free to explore this repository and start experimenting with the provided workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the workflows in this repository rely on specific LoRA models, Checkpoints and Embeddings that are not included here. To use these workflows correctly, please download the required LoRAs and Checkpoints from their respective sources before attempting to run them. Please refer to the individual workflow documentation for details on which LoRAs and Checkpoints are needed.

## Usage

You'll find two ways to import the pre-configured workflows into your own ComfyUI instance. First, you can simply drag-and-drop the PNG image located in `workflows/` into your ComfyUI interface. Alternatively, you can import the workflow directly from its JSON file, which is also available in that same directory.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute your own experiments, findings, or even corrections to this project, please feel free to do so! This is a community-driven effort to help others learn and grow with [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/).

## Note

This project is for educational purposes only. Please use the workflows within this repository responsibly.
